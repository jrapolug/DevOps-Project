- Adding GitHub Webhooks for Continuous Integration and Continuos Delivery
**_Lets Start the Project by Launching an EC2 Instance and configuring it by installing Jenkins and Docker in it._**

### Launching an EC2 Instance

- Goto AWS EC2 Service and Select Launch instances.

- Select Ubuntu Free Tier AMI.

    /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
  echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
  echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
  sudo apt install docker-compose -y
  sudo usermod -a -G $USER docker
  ```
  **_Note: Please reboot your instance so that your user will be added to docker and you can run docker commands without using sudo._**
